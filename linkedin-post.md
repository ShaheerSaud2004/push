# LinkedIn Post for Khafī

Assalamualaikum-warahmatullah, hope all is well. I was thinking about games we play during Ramadan - with friends, at MSA/FLOI events, high school events, and in general Muslim gatherings—and it hit me: why isn't there a Muslim imposter-style game made for our community?

Think of it as a group game where one player doesn't know the secret word, and everyone figures out who it is through questions and discussion. (For those unfamiliar: an imposter game is where most players know a secret word, but one or more "imposters" don't - and the group has to figure out who the imposters are through clues and discussion.)

So with some coding experience (and a lot of Cursor), plus time spent during shura meetings and at the Alexander Library, I decided to build one. I'm excited to share Khafī (خفي) - The Islamic Hidden Word Game 🎮

A fun, pass-and-play party game designed specifically for the Muslim community. Think of it as an imposter-style game infused with Islamic knowledge and culture.

**What makes Khafī special:**
✨ 20+ Islamic categories (Prophets, Seerah, Ramadan, Quran concepts, and more)
🎯 Multiple game modes, including Quiz Mode and special challenges
👥 Designed for 3–20 players — perfect for family gatherings, MSA events, and youth groups
🎨 Clean design inspired by Islamic geometric patterns
🆓 Completely free — no ads, no in-app purchases, no subscriptions

Whether you're at a family gathering, an Islamic event, or just hanging out with friends, Khafī brings people together through laughter, learning, and friendly competition.

📱 **Available now on iOS**

I built Khafī because I wanted a game that truly speaks to our community - where Islamic knowledge, values, and culture are at the heart of the experience. It's great for college settings, youth events, and honestly, all ages.

I'm planning to release new updates every week, in shā' Allāh - so if anyone has ideas, feature requests, or wants to help out in any way, please let me know. I'd love to build this together with the community.

Try it out and let me know what you think 🤍
