# Screenshots Needed

To complete your website, add these screenshots to the `website/` folder:

1. **screenshot-hero.png** - Main hero image (card reveal screen, like the one you showed me)
   - Recommended size: 750x1334px (iPhone dimensions)
   - This will be shown in the hero section

2. **screenshot-menu.png** - Menu screen
   - Shows the main menu with "Get Started" and "How to Play" buttons

3. **screenshot-setup.png** - Game setup screen
   - Shows the game configuration interface

4. **screenshot-card.png** - Card reveal screen
   - Shows the beautiful card design with geometric patterns

## How to Take Screenshots

1. Run your app in Expo Go or a simulator
2. Navigate to each screen
3. Take a screenshot (Cmd+Shift+3 on Mac, or use the device's screenshot feature)
4. Save them in the `website/` folder with the names above
5. Refresh your browser to see them on the site

The website will automatically display them once the files are added!
