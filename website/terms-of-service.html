            <h2>4. Limitations</h2>
            <p>In no event shall Khafī or its suppliers be liable for any damages (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data or profit, or due to business interruption) arising out of the use or inability to use the App, even if Khafī or a Khafī authorized representative has been notified orally or in writing of the possibility of such damage.</p>

            <h2>5. Accuracy of Materials</h2>
            <p>The materials appearing in Khafī could include technical, typographical, or photographic errors. Khafī does not warrant that any of the materials on its App are accurate, complete, or current. Khafī may make changes to the materials contained on its App at any time without notice.</p>

            <h2>6. Links</h2>
            <p>Khafī has not reviewed all of the sites linked to its App and is not responsible for the contents of any such linked site. The inclusion of any link does not imply endorsement by Khafī of the site. Use of any such linked website is at the user's own risk.</p>

            <h2>7. Modifications</h2>
            <p>Khafī may revise these terms of service for its App at any time without notice. By using this App you are agreeing to be bound by the then current version of these terms of service.</p>

            <h2>8. Governing Law</h2>
